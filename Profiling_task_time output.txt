1 Read and write

Pandas time:
 100k rows 0.361504
 1k rows   0.006133

CSV time:
 100k rows 0.392584
 1k rows   0.004096

Functions using these modules occupy the same amount of memory, but
CSV is faster to load data for smaller datasets (< 1K rows). Pandas is several times faster for larger datasets.


2 List transformation

list transformation 1 time:
 5 values  0.000684   
 5k values 0.475276

list transformation 2 time:
 5 values  0.000667  
 5k values 0.348293

list transformation 3 time:
 5 values  0.001024   
 5k values 0.511137


Functions using these modules occupy the same amount of memory.
Fastest "list transformation 2" with a List Comprehension. 
"list transformation 1" takes 2nd place, it is slower due to append.
"list transformation 3" with map works the longest, but most likely this is due to the constant call to lambda.
In the case of List Comprehension, we only need a transformation.


3 Sort              time 

 pd sort_values     2.707479   
 selection sort     0.044379
 method sorted      0.001299
 


Functions using these modules occupy the same amount of memory
Method sorted () is the fastest, no need to reinvent bubble sort or selection sort - it's better to use the standard method.


4 Unpacking

 unpacking1 time  0.004438
 unpacking2 time  0.000481


The "unpacking_1" function using List Comprehension is faster than the "unpacking_1" function.
The "unpacking_2" function has a more complex structure with 3 for and append loops.
